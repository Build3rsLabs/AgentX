# AgentX Business Model

## Overview

AgentX employs a multi-tiered business model designed to create sustainable revenue while maximizing value for users across different segments. Our approach balances accessibility for new users with premium features for power users and institutional clients.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Freemium Subscription Model

**Free Tier:**
- Access to basic platform features
- Limited to 3 active positions
- Standard AI assistant capabilities
- Basic portfolio analytics
- Manual rebalancing only

**Premium Subscription ($10/month or $99/year):**
- Unlimited active positions
- Advanced AI assistant with personalized strategies
- Comprehensive portfolio analytics and reporting
- Automated rebalancing
- Priority support
- Strategy backtesting tools
- Custom alerts and notifications

### 2. Performance Fee Structure

For users who prefer a success-based model rather than a fixed subscription:

- 5% fee on yields above benchmark (e.g., single-asset staking APY)
- Fee only applies to the outperformance, not total yield
- Monthly calculation and collection
- Performance fee waived for Premium subscribers

Example:
- User has 1,000 EGLD in positions
- Benchmark yield is 8% APY
- AgentX achieves 15% APY
- Fee applies to the 7% outperformance (15% - 8%)
- Fee amount: 1,000 EGLD × 7% × 5% = 3.5 EGLD annually
