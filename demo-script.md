# AgentX Hackathon Demo Script

## Introduction (1 minute)

Hello everyone! I'm excited to present AgentX, an AI-powered yield optimization platform for the MultiversX ecosystem. AgentX helps users maximize their DeFi returns while managing risk through automated strategies and personalized recommendations.

## Problem Statement (1 minute)

DeFi on MultiversX offers incredible yield opportunities, but users face three major challenges:
1. **Complexity** - Too many protocols, pools, and strategies to evaluate
2. **Risk Management** - Difficulty balancing yield and risk
3. **Active Management** - Constant monitoring needed to optimize returns

AgentX solves these problems with AI-powered agents that manage your portfolio based on your risk preferences.

## Platform Demo (5 minutes)

### Dashboard Overview
*[Navigate to the Dashboard]*

This is our main dashboard, showing how AgentX works:
- Each user gets a dedicated agent that operates through a secure wallet
- The agent manages your assets across MultiversX protocols
- It automatically optimizes for the best yields based on your risk profile
- You can customize your strategy through our intuitive interface

### AI Assistant Demo
*[Click on "Chat with Your Agent" or navigate to Chat page]*

Our AI assistant is the heart of AgentX. Let me show you how it works:

*[Ask the following questions]*
1. "What are the highest APY opportunities right now?"
2. "I prefer low-risk investments. What do you recommend?"
3. "I want to invest 50 EGLD. Can you suggest a portfolio allocation?"

As you can see, the assistant provides personalized recommendations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It can explain complex DeFi concepts, compare protocols, and create custom strategies.

### Earn Interface
*[Navigate to the Earn page]*

The Earn interface is where users can:
- View their active positions across protocols
- Create new positions with custom parameters
- Deposit additional funds or withdraw from existing positions
- Monitor performance metrics and transaction history

Let me demonstrate creating a new position:
*[Click "New Position" button]*

1. Select a pool (e.g., EGLD-MEX LP)
2. Enter deposit amount
3. Choose a strategy (Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive)
4. Review and confirm

The agent will now manage this position according to the selected strategy, automatically rebalancing to maximize returns.

### Protocol Explorer
*[Navigate to Protocols page]*

Users can explore all supported protocols on MultiversX:
- Compare TVL, APY, and risk levels
- Filter by risk preference or token type
- Access detailed information about each protocol

### Pool Explorer
*[Navigate to Pools page]*

The Pools page allows users to:
- Discover the highest-yielding opportunities
- Filter by protocol, risk level, or minimum APY
- Compare different pools side by side

### Asset Overview
*[Navigate to Assets page]*

Users can track the performance of tokens in the MultiversX ecosystem:
- View current prices and 24-hour changes
- Monitor tokens used in their positions
- Discover new investment opportunities

## Demo Q&A Preparation

### Potential Questions and Answers

**Q: How does the AI agent make decisions about rebalancing?**
A: The agent uses a combination of historical data analysis, current market conditions, and risk parameters to determine optimal rebalancing times. It considers gas costs, impermanent loss risk, and potential yield improvements before executing any transactions.

**Q: How do you ensure the security of user funds?**
A: Security is our top priority. The agent operates through non-custodial smart contracts, meaning users always maintain control of their funds. All contracts are audited by leading security firms, and we implement a comprehensive risk management framework.

**Q: What makes AgentX different from other yield aggregators?**
A: Three key differentiators: 1) Our AI assistant provides personalized guidance rather than just data, 2) Our agents actively manage positions rather than just aggregating yields, and 3) Our focus on the MultiversX ecosystem allows us to optimize specifically for its unique protocols and opportunities.

**Q: How do you plan to acquire users?**
A: Our go-to-market strategy includes partnerships with key MultiversX protocols, educational content marketing, community building through our Discord and Telegram, and a referral program that rewards users for bringing friends to the platform.

**Q: What are the biggest challenges you anticipate?**
A: The main challenges are keeping up with the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape, ensuring our AI recommendations remain accurate as new protocols emerge, and building trust with users who may be hesitant to adopt automated strategies. We're addressing these through continuous learning systems, partnerships with protocols for early access, and transparent performance reporting.
