# AgentX Demo Walkthrough Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for demonstrating AgentX during your hackathon presentation. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth, compelling demo that showcases all key features.

## Pre-Demo Setup

1. **Prepare your environment**
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
   - Close unnecessary applications to prevent distractions
   - Set up your browser with the AgentX application loaded
   - Have a MultiversX wallet ready with some test EGLD (can be testnet)

2. **Practice the flow**
   - Rehearse the entire demo at least 3 times before the presentation
   - Time each section to ensure you stay within the allocated time
   - Prepare for potential technical issues with backup plans

## Demo Flow

### 1. Dashboard Introduction (1 minute)

- **Start at:** Home page (Dashboard)
- **Key points to highlight:**
  - Clean, intuitive interface designed for both beginners and experts
  - Real-time data from MultiversX ecosystem
  - The four-step process of how AgentX works (point to each card)
  - Top performing pools section showing current opportunities

**Script:** "Welcome to AgentX, the intelligent yield optimization platform for MultiversX. Our dashboard provides a clear overview of how our platform works. Each user gets a dedicated agent that operates through a secure wallet on the MultiversX blockchain. The agent manages your assets across protocols, automatically seeking the best yields while adhering to your risk preferences. You can customize your strategy through our intuitive interface or chat directly with your agent."

### 2. AI Assistant Demonstration (2 minutes)

- **Navigate to:** Click "Chat with Your Agent" button or go to Chat page
- **Demo interactions:**
  - Ask: "What are the highest APY opportunities right now?"
  - Ask: "I prefer low-risk investments. What do you recommend?"
  - Ask: "I want to invest 50 EGLD. Can you suggest a portfolio allocation?"

**Script:** "The heart of our platform is the AI assistant. Let me show you how it works. I'll ask about current opportunities... [ask question] As you can see, the assistant provides detailed information about yields across different protocols. Now, let's specify my risk preference... [ask question] Notice how the recommendations change to focus on lower-risk options. Finally, I'll ask for a specific allocation... [ask question] The assistant creates a personalized portfolio strategy based on my investment amount and previously stated risk preference."

### 3. Earn Interface (2 minutes)

- **Navigate to:** Earn page
- **Features to demonstrate:**
  - Protocol selector dropdown
  - Protocol overview with key metrics
  - Positions tab showing current investments
  - Creating a new position

**Script:** "The Earn interface is where users manage their yield positions. First, you select a protocol from this dropdown. Let's choose Maiar Exchange. Here we see key protocol information including TVL, APY, and risk level. Below, users can view their active positions. Since we're new, let's create a position by clicking 'New Position'."

- **Demo position creation:**
  - Select a pool (e.g., EGLD-MEX LP)
  - Enter 5 EGLD as deposit amount
  - Choose "Balanced" strategy
  - Show the confirmation screen
  - Complete the process

**Script:** "I'll select the EGLD-MEX liquidity pool, which currently offers 18.5% APY with medium risk. I'll deposit 5 EGLD and choose a balanced strategy. The confirmation screen shows all details including gas fees. Once confirmed, our agent would begin managing this position according to the balanced strategy parameters, automatically rebalancing to maximize returns while maintaining moderate risk."

### 4. Protocol Explorer (1 minute)

- **Navigate to:** Protocols page
- **Features to demonstrate:**
  - Filtering and sorting options
  - Protocol cards with key information
  - Risk indicators

**Script:** "Our Protocol Explorer allows users to discover and compare all supported protocols on MultiversX. Users can filter by risk level or sort by TVL, APY, or name. Each card shows essential information including supported assets and current yields. The color-coded risk indicators make it easy to identify protocols that match your risk tolerance."

### 5. Pool Explorer (1 minute)

- **Navigate to:** Pools page
- **Features to demonstrate:**
  - Advanced filtering options
  - Detailed pool information
  - Comparison capabilities

**Script:** "The Pool Explorer takes this a step further, allowing users to discover specific pools across all protocols. Users can filter by protocol, risk level, or minimum APY. This makes it easy to find the exact yield opportunity you're looking for, whether you're seeking stable returns or maximum yields."

### 6. Asset Overview (1 minute)

- **Navigate to:** Assets page
- **Features to demonstrate:**
  - Token price information
  - 24-hour changes
  - Trading functionality

**Script:** "Finally, our Asset Overview provides real-time information on MultiversX tokens. Users can track prices, monitor 24-hour changes, and quickly access trading functionality. This is particularly useful for monitoring the tokens used in your yield positions."

## Closing the Demo

Return to the Dashboard and summarize the key benefits:

**Script:** "As you've seen, AgentX combines powerful AI, automation, and user-friendly design to make sophisticated yield strategies accessible to everyone. Our platform handles the complexity of DeFi so users can focus on their investment goals rather than the technical details of yield farming. We're excited to continue building the future of DeFi on MultiversX."

## Handling Questions

Be prepared for these common questions:

1. **Security:** "Security is our top priority. All agent operations are executed through non-custodial smart contracts, meaning users always maintain control of their funds."

2. **Fees:** "We plan a freemium model with basic features available to all users and premium features available through a subscription or performance fee structure."

3. **Comparison to competitors:** "Unlike general yield aggregators, AgentX provides active management through AI agents and focuses specifically on optimizing for the MultiversX ecosystem."

4. **Technical implementation:** "Our platform is built on React with TypeScript, integrating directly with the MultiversX blockchain through their SDK. The AI assistant uses advanced NLP techniques with context awareness."

5. **Roadmap:** "Our immediate roadmap includes enhanced AI capabilities, expanded protocol support, and advanced features like leveraged strategies and institutional tools."

## Technical Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the demo:

1. **Connection problems:** Have screenshots ready of each main screen to continue the presentation
2. **Wallet connection issues:** Prepare a pre-connected backup browser window
3. **AI assistant not responding:** Have prepared example responses ready to show
4. **General errors:** Acknowledge the issue briefly, mention it's a prototype, and continue with the next feature

Remember: A smooth recovery from a technical issue can actually demonstrate your problem-solving abilities to judges!
